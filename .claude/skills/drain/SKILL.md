name: drain
description: Work this repo's queue (yajna) one task at a time. Invoke as /drain for a plain drain, or /drain super <priority> to keep going until nothing at or above that floor is left. Use when Ita says "drain the queue", "drain your queue" or "super drain <priority>".

# Draining

`CLAUDE.md` says what the words mean — whose queue this is, what the two modes are, one task one agent, and that the dispatcher sets the priority of what its workers file. Read those there; they hold all day, not only during a drain. **This file is only how to execute one, and deliberately does not restate them.**

## 1. Settle the mode before reading anything

| Invocation | Mode |
|---|---|
| `/drain` | plain drain — the queue as it stands when the drain starts |
| `/drain super low` (or `high`, `medium`, `ASAP`) | super drain with that floor |
| `/drain super` | **not a command.** Ask which floor. Do not guess one |

## 2. Take your slice of the board

The queue's order, Status and Priority live on the project, not in the issues, so one read gets them:

```bash
/home/ita/coo/tools/board list --tsv | awk -F'\t' '$4 == "yajna"'
```

That is 1 GraphQL point for the whole board, in project order. `--tsv` is: position, item id, type, **repo**, issue number, Status, Priority, Worker, Due, title — the count line goes to stderr, so it does not reach the filter. Yours is what `CLAUDE.md` says is yours — normally exactly those rows, and never another repo's.

Then drop, in this order:

- `Worker: ita` — skip.
- `Blocked` — skip; name the blocker in your report. If it has since cleared, unblock it and work it.
- `Review` — skip; it is waiting on its named human. If no human is named, that is the bug: name one in the body and leave it there.
- `backlog` — skip.
- On a super drain only: everything below the floor.

What survives is worked in project order.

## 3. One item at a time

For each, in this order:

```bash
n=<n>
gh api repos/theitush/yajna/issues/$n -q .body     # REST; gh issue view is GraphQL
/home/ita/coo/tools/sign yajna $n <YourName>                 # before the work, not after
/home/ita/coo/tools/board set yajna $n Status "In Progress"  # before the work, so a crash leaves evidence
```

Do the work. Verify it — tests, build, a read of the diff — because the result is a claim you are signing. Then file whatever the work did not reach as its own issue *before* this one closes — `CLAUDE.md` has that rule — and finish it exactly one of three ways:

**Done** — verified, remainder filed and named in the result:

```bash
{ gh api repos/theitush/yajna/issues/$n -q .body
  printf '\n---\n**Result**\n\n%s\n\n— %s\n' "<what was done, how it was verified, Left over: #a, #b>" "<Your Full Name>"; } > /tmp/task-$n.md
gh api -X PATCH repos/theitush/yajna/issues/$n -F body=@/tmp/task-$n.md -f state=closed
/home/ita/coo/tools/board set yajna $n Status Done
```

**Review** — finished, but a person has to look. Issue stays **open**; write the one-line `**Review:** <who> — <what> — <where>` as the body's first line, replacing any existing one, and `/home/ita/coo/tools/board set yajna $n Status Review`. Your commit says `Refs #n`, never `Closes #n` — a closing keyword erases the review request the moment it lands.

**Blocked** — you cannot proceed at all. Blocker written into the body, issue open, `Status Blocked`. Not a place to park work you are merely unsure of: that is Done with the doubt in the result.

## 4. Close out the pass

Before you report, and every time:

1. **Set the priority of every issue this drain filed yourself.** Read each one against the whole board, not from inside the task that produced it. Say in the report which you changed and why.
2. Reorder the queue if the work changed what should run next.
3. `/home/ita/coo/tools/board pending` — flush anything a budget blackout queued.
4. Whatever your `CLAUDE.md` asks of a session before it ends.
5. Commit **by path** and push. Never `-A`: the tree is shared. An agent's report names the paths it left uncommitted; commit those and nothing else.

## 5. Super drain only: go round again

Re-read the board and repeat from step 2 while anything of yours sits at or above the floor — including what this drain just filed. Step 4.1 is what makes that terminate: leftovers priced from inside their parent task will otherwise keep landing at or above the floor forever.

## 6. Report

Per item: what it was, what you did, how you verified, where it landed (Done / Review-and-who / Blocked-and-why), and what it left behind. Then the queue's new state, and anything you skipped with the reason.
